                <h2>Stanza-1</h2><br>
                <div class="stanza1">We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January <br>
                    And this is our place, we make the rules <br>
                    And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear<br>
                    <p class="line3">Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?</p></div> <br>
                <h2>Stanza-2</h2><br>
                <div class="stanza2"><p class="line2">Can I go where you go?</p>
                    Can we always be this close forever and ever? <br>
                    And ah, take me out, and take me home <br>
                <p class="line1">You're my, my, my, my <br>
                    Lover</p>
                </div><br>
                <h2>Stanza-3</h2><br>
                <div class="stanza3">We could let our friends crash in the living room <br>
                    This is our place, we make the call <br>
                    And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you <br>
                    <p class="line3">I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all</p></div><br>
                <h2>Stanza-4</h2><br>

                    <p class="line2">Can I go where you go?</p>
                    Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
                    And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)<br>
                    <p class="line1">You're my, my, my, my<br>
                    Lover</p></div><br>
                <h2>Stanza-4</h2><br>
                <div class="stanza5"><p class="line2">Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?</p>
                    With every guitar string scar on my hand<br>
                    I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover<br>
                    My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue<br>
                    All's well that ends well to end up with you<br>
                    Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover<br>
                    And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me<br>
                    And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover</div><br>
                <h2>Stanza-6</h2><br>

                    Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
                    And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)<br>
                    You're my, my, my, my<br>
                    Oh, you're my, my, my, my<br>
                    <p class="line1">Darling, you're my, my, my, my<br>
                    Lover...</p></div><br>
